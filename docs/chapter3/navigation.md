# Navigation

Every app uses some way of navigation. In modern iOS apps there are mostly two different types of navigation:

- Flat navigation: You switch between different categories. For example, switching between reels and photos in Instagram.
- Hierarchical navigation: You select an item on a screen and navigate to this item. For example, you select a conversation in WhatsApp.

In SwiftUI we have two main components to build these types of navigation. We start with the flat navigation that we can build using a `TabView`.
